### Tuts+ Tutorial: Creating Your First Universal Windows App

#### Instructor: Vivek Maskara

Universal Windows apps enable you to target every Windows device in one solution. You develop once, share most of your code, and deploy on Windows, Windows Phone, or Xbox. The goal is to maximize the reuse of code. You can share code, user controls, styles, strings, and other assets between the Windows Phone and Windows 8 projects in Visual Studio. This reduces the effort needed in building and maintaining an app for each type of device.
